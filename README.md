## ⚙️ Act I — The Empty Repository  

> *“Nothing will come of nothing.”*  
> — *King Lear, Act I, Scene I*  

This repository is but a dream, a whisper of what *might* be.  
Its contents are as barren as the moon, yet full of potential.

## 💻 Act II — The Developer’s Lament  

> *“I would challenge you to a battle of wits, but I see you are unarmed.”*  
> — *Much Ado About Nothing, Act V, Scene I*  

There is no code, no readme instructions, no dependencies —  
only a solemn promise that one day, something *beautifully hacky* shall emerge.

## 🧠 Act III — The Hope  

> *“Things won are done; joy’s soul lies in the doing.”*  
> — *Troilus and Cressida, Act I, Scene II*  

Soon shall the commits flow, the branches blossom,  
and the pull requests multiply like midsummer dreams.

> *“Lord, what fools these mortals be!”*

Aye, thou hast come seeking wisdom or code,  
and found instead this hollow echo of ambition.

## ⚔️ Act V — The Curtain Falls  

> *“If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?”*  
> — *The Merchant of Venice, Act III, Scene I*  

Star this repository, fair traveler,  
for though it sleeps now, it shall awake with thunderous commits anon.
